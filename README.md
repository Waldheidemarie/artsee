## Description
An interactive street art discovery app that allows users to upload their street art photography using built-in camera functionality. The app pins each photo to a map indicating exactly where the photo was taken and adds it to a main feed. Additional map features include a "discovery" button that allows users to find the closest piece of street art in relation to their current position as well as narrowing down street art to a 1.5km radius. 

In the feed, users can not only comment on each unique photo, but mark them as "liked", "visited" or bookmark them for later. A filter feature lets users only seee the most seen, liked or bookmark photos. Photos that have been marked by a user appear in their profile, where they can select each category under a tab and view their collection. They can also click on an individual photo and either unmark it or add a comment.
